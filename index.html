    <p><strong>About me:</strong></p>
<p>Benjamin Scott Raven has worked for MLive Media Group for 11-plus years, including as a Detroit Lions beat writer for the last six seasons. Raven, who also writes about me sections in the third-person, did a little bit of everything before finding his spot at MLive on the Lions beat. He is the son, an only child, of a butcher who worked in several meat rooms for most of his life before receiving his bachelor's degree in Journalism -- News and Editorial from Central Michigan University in 2013. Before that, Raven spent two years at Davenport University where he was a member of the men's basketball team.</p>

<p>Prior to covering the Lions, he also served as a regular on ESPN 96.1 FM in Michigan, managed The Court of Nerds website, moderated Grand Rapids Comic Con, handled play-by-play duties for Combat 1 Pro Wrestling and even trained in the field at the Can-Am American Dojo in Windsor, Ontario, Canada for two years.</p>
